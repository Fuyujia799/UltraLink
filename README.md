## News
- ❗️❗️ Febrary 6, 2024: Releasing a multi-lingual, knowledge-grounded data augmented, multi-round dialogue dataset UltraLink and the model weight of UltraLink-LM.

## UltraLink
UltraLink is a multi-lingual, knowledge-grounded data augmented, multi-round dialogue dataset. It contains language-specific chat data, language-agnostic chat data, code data and math data in 5 languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, Russian, and French. It can be downloaded in this huggingface [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/R0k1e/UltraLink).
Different from previous works that simply translate English instructions, we consider both the language-specific and language-agnostic abilities of LLMs. Firstly, we introduce a knowledge-grounded data augmentation approach to elicit more culture-specific knowledge of LLMs, improving their ability to serve users from different countries. Moreover, we find modern LLMs possess strong cross-lingual transfer capabilities, thus repeatedly learning identical content in various languages is not necessary. Consequently, we can substantially prune the language-agnostic SFT data without any performance degradation, making multilingual SFT more efficient. 

## UltraLink-LM
> The UltraLink-LM is a massively multilingual generative language model that follows instructions in 5 languages, English, French, Russian, Spanish, and Chinese. The model is capable of generating text in 5 languages with high quality and diversity.
> UltraLink-LM outperforms [PolyLM-Chat-13b](https://huggingface.co/DAMO-NLP-MT/polylm-chat-13b), [Guanaco](JosephusCheung/Guanaco),  and [Bloomz-7b1-mt](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloomz-7b1-mt) in code, math and chat abilities in four languages, and has a high-quality and diverse text generation performance in all languages.
> The UltraLink-LM is trained using [UltraLink](https://huggingface.co/datasets/R0k1e/UltraLink), [UltraChat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/stingning/ultrachat), [Magicoder-Evol](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ise-uiuc/Magicoder-Evol-Instruct-110K), [Magicoder-OSS](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ise-uiuc/Magicoder-OSS-Instruct-75K), [MetaMathQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/meta-math/MetaMathQA), and [ShareGPT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/openchat/openchat_sharegpt4_dataset/).
> We release the checkpoints under a MIT license to further our mission of multilingual technologies empowering a multilingual world. It can be downloaded in this huggingface [link](https://huggingface.co/R0k1e/UltraLink-LM).

<details><summary> <b> Performance </b> </summary>
<p>

We report three evaluations in this section: multilingual HumanEval, MGSM, and OMGEval.
Evaluations of modern LLMs may be biased and affected by many factors, we are also actively working on more comprehensive evaluation methods.

### Multilingual HumanEval 

[HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval) is a well-known benchmark for evaluating the code ability of LLMs. It execute the code snippets generated by the model and evaluate their correctness.  Since there are no existing multilingual test set for code generation, we use GPT-3.5 with carefully-designed prompts to translation HumanEval into other languages.

### MGSM

We employ [MGSM](https://github.com/google-research/url-nlp/tree/main/mgsm) to evaluate the math reasoning abilities, which is a multilingual benchmark. It compares the result with correct answers and evaluates the model's ability to perform mathematical reasoning.
|Model|En|Zh|Es|Ru|Fr|Avg|

|UltraLink-LM| __70.4__ | __56.0__ | __70.4__ | __64.8__ | __63.6__ | __63.7__ |

### OMGEval
We use the [OMGEval](https://github.com/blcuicall/OMGEval) to evaluate the chat ability, which is a multilingual version of the widely-used English benchmark AlpacaEval.

- 🤗 [Huggingface Datasets Host](https://huggingface.co/datasets/R0k1e/UltraLink)


### Data Format
Each line in the downloaded data file is a json dict containing the data id and dialogue data in a list format. The id is begin wizh the file name and connected with the sequence number. Below is an example line.

```
{"id": "en_chat_agnostic_0", "data": ["At the beginning of the training, tell me about an ice breaker that will help participants relax.", "Sure, here's an ice breaker activity that you can use
 to help participants relax and get to know each other:\n\n\"Two Truths and a Lie\"\n\nAsk each participant to come up with three statements about themselves, two of which are true and one of w
hich is false. The other participants then have to guess which statement is the lie.\n\nThis activity is a great way to get to know each other while having some fun. It's also a good way to enc
ourage communication and interaction among the participants. You can modify the activity to suit your group's preferences, such as asking participants to share their favorite hobby or their mos
t memorable vacation, and then guess which one is the lie.", "Tell me another ice-breaker.", "Sure, here's another ice-breaker activity that you can use:\n\n\"Who Am I?\"\n\nWrite the name of a
 famous person, fictional character, or historical figure on a sticky note, and then stick it on the forehead of each participant without showing them who they are. Each participant has to ask 
yes or no questions to figure out who they are.\n\nThis activity is a fun and engaging way to break the ice and get people talking to each other. It's also a great way to encourage creative thi
nking and problem-solving. You can modify the activity to suit your group's preferences, such as using famous quotes or song lyrics instead of famous people."]}

## Construction of UltraLink
<img src="flow_diagram.png" alt="flow diagram" width="800" style="margin-left:'auto' margin-right:'auto' display:'block'"/>
 In this work, we propose a construction framework consisting of two pipelines. The language-specific pipeline employs a newly introduced knowledge-grounded data augmentation approach to generate conversations with detailed cultural backgrounds. The language-agnostic pipeline leverages a two-stage translation mechanism to effectively utilize the existing English SFT data, with fewer translation errors caused by cultural differences. 
 
### Pipeline 1: Language-Specific Pipeline
The cultures around the world are vibrant and diverse, reflecting the lifestyles and perspectives of people from various countries and regions. To better cater to diverse users, the cultural diversity of multilingual LLMs should be improved. In this work, we propose a knowledge-grounded data augmentation method, leveraging language-specific knowledge bases to provide intricate and varied cultural backgrounds. Our method mainly contains two steps: (1) preparing and sampling knowledge from knowledge bases as cultural backgrounds, and (2) steering LLMs to generate informative conversations given the provided cultural backgrounds.

### Pipeline 2: Language-Agnostic Pipeline
In addition to language-specific abilities, the general abilities that are language-agnostic are also essential for LLMs. As numerous high-quality English SFT datasets already encompass a broad spectrum of general abilities, we suggest employing a two-stage translation mechanism to maximize the utility of existing English resources. Our goal is to reduce translation errors caused by cultural differences, since some questions can not be directly translated into other languages (e.g., write an English poem where each sentence starts with the letter "A"). In the first stage, we introduce a multi-criteria mechanism to filter out English-specific conversations that are difficult to translate accurately into other languages. Then we use GPT-3.5 to translate the remaining language-agnostic data. 
In this study, we consider three key components of general abilities for LLMs: chat, math reasoning, and code generation. For chat, we use ShareGPT as the English chat data, which consists of multi-turn dialogues between human users and ChatGPT. For math reasoning, we use MetaMath as the English math data. For code generation, we use the Magicoder dataset as the English code data.
